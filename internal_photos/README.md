The photos in this directory were taken when adding the ON/OFF button. They were taken with my camera so quality is poor (was also fairly dark inside the unit).

## Notes on taking apart

### Top Plate

Remove all the hex screws from the top-side. You can move the head around to access various bolts.
You don't have to take anything OFF the top plate, but you will have all the cables still going through that top aluminum plate. Thus the easiest (only?)
way is to use 2x3s or 2x4s as "stand-offs" to provide you with some working room and simply hold the top plate up a little bit.

Note you can also remove the front panel which has some good access holes.

### Front Panel

The front panel is a piece of aluminum held on with 6x screws. These screws are underneath of a printed plastic panel that is glued on - you
have no real choice but to peel this front panel back. You can then remove the screws, and there is some nice holes in the front side (they 
would hold the LCD for the other model with an integrated LCD) that can be helpful to work through.
